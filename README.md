# library-management
Application for managing a library with literary volumes. There are two types of volumes in the library: short stories (author, title, publisher) and volumes of poems (author, title, number of poems).
The application helps the librarian in the management of volumes, operations such as adding, deleting volumes, borrowing volumes, returning volumes, searching for volumes and viewing volumes sorted by author. The data is saved in memory.
